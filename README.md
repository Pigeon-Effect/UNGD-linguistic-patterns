# UNGD-linguistic-patterns
An investigation of the evolution of linguistic properties across all speeches of the UNGD between 1946 and 2022 aims to measure the extent to which language has changed in its resemblance to fake news. To avoid the heuristic arbitrari-ness of labeling fake and factual, language properties such as average sentence length, linguistic complexity, readability, sentiment and fake news likelihood of a BERT-based fake-news classifier are measured in a time series analysis. The results reveal a complicated and contradictory linguistic topography. Words of crisis are increasing in proportion, but the share of emotionalizing modal adverbs, degree adverbs, negations and swear words are decreasing. The average sentence length decreases, readability increases, but lexical complexity increases, and language becomes more objec-tive. The classifier shows a valley around the 1980s with an increased likelihood of fake news in the 1950s and since the early 2000s.
